# STUB
This page is a stub and needs to be filled out.
## Notes
This page is to explain how there is little-to-no push back to looking into why people have the sexual orientation or gender identity they do, but that we shouldn't ban present best practices treatment for a "potentially someday perfect cure".

Following can be used as examples:

* Cancer
* Erectile Dysfunction
* Wheelchairs
* Banning driving until every car can self-drive for safety.

TODO: Find more examples.

...This page is gonna be *fun* to write.
