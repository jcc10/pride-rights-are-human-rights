# What is Breast Reduction Surgery

# Reasons why a Boy or Man would want to get the surgery.

# Now lets add "Trans" before every gender!

And now suddenly, most of the statements are controversial! This means it's not a universal right but rather a privilege.

# Hard Numbers

## Cis Vs Trans
/// How many reported incidences of cis-males receiving the treatment vs trans-males?

## Ages
/// At what ages is the treatment being preformed.
/// Try to get what percentage in each age range are trans vs cis.

## Notes
This page is to note how Breast Reduction Gender Affirming Care is commonly used for Cis-Boys and Cis-Men who have gynecomastia.

It should also probably note how some Cis-Women get Breast Reduction for various reasons (not always medical) and how they can get looked down on because of that. (And how that is also not good.)
